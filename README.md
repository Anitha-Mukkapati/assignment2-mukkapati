###### My Favorite place in the world is Maldives

>The Maldives, a collection of more than a thousand islands in the **Indian Ocean**, is known for its clear emerald waters, beautiful beaches that stretch as far as the eye can see, and of course **luxurious overwater bungalows**. With features like these, the archipelago makes for an idyllic sanctuary where guests can **snorkel**, **scuba dive**, **swim**, and **savor** some truly unforgettable sunsets. Aside from being one of the most **stunning island getaways in the world**, the Maldives is also a perfect addition to an itinerary for travelers visiting magnificent South Asian cities or Middle Eastern capitals.
